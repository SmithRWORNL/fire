Parsers in Fire implement the IParser interface, which can either be implemented through direct interface realization or by using template specialization
for local parsers when appropriate.

## Local Parsers

Local Parsers in Fire represent parsers for resources that are on the local machine (i.e. - localhost). These can be streams or files, depending on the
implementation. Local Parsers implement ILocalParser or specialize the LocalParser<T> template.

### Templated Local Parsers

Specializations of LocalParser<T> should be created in the "fire" namespace. See astrophysics/SpeciesLocalParser.h for an example.

This is required by the C++ standard. If you do not create your specialization in the "fire" namespace, you will get an error like the following

```
error: specialization of ‘template<class T> class fire::LocalParser’ in different namespace [-fpermissive]
 class LocalParser<std::vector<Species>> {
```

### Delimited Text Parsers

One special class of parsers are parsers for delimited text, which is dense text with entries of the same type separated by a common *delimiter,* like a comma, space, or other character. Fire has a special subclass of LocalParser, called the DelimitedTextParser, that should be used for this type of text.
